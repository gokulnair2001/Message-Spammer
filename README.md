So this is not a solely standing app, the framework can be inherited to any chatting app to remove spammers.

# Imortant Message 

* I started this app with an idea to create a spammer which removes unknown people who flirt with people, but the i realise with the model that the app even makes normal
conversation as spam, so decided to make it a message spammer which removes spam messages.
